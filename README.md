How to use the new HO features in OgreBot.
HO Start - This means starting a HO when there is not one active. Example: Fighter's is called Fighting Chance
HO Starter - This means the HO has been activated, and you now are picking which HO to advance before the final HO shows up.
HO Wheel - This is the actual HO. When this finishes, something happens (such as a damage nuke, a buff, etc)

These work by determining if you have any abilities that can be cast that would advance the HO, and it chooses the fastest casting ability.
This works great... except some classes have some abilities that are very bad.
While some long term plans have this list be managed by a UI.. those are exactly what they are, long term plans. In the  short term, if you're capable of editing a text file, you can do the following:


Folder struction: C:\Games\Innerspace\Scripts\EQ2OgreBot\HeroicOpportunity\
Files are: HO_class.xml, IE: HO_guardian.xml

<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>

        <Setting Name="Overpower"></Setting>
    </Set>
